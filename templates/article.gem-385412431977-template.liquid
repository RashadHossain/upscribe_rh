Fortunately, there's an abundance of information available today that has been collected over the centuries, in the hopes of developing useful products. There's no way around it; the benefits of herbal medicine are becoming clearer by the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing that we need to do is look at hormone regulation in men. The major hormones that cause most men's problems in fertility and libido are testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen. Since these are the primary hormones that are responsible for male characteristics, including hair, strength, and the ability to reproduce, it makes sense that taking these nutrients and getting rid of excess production is important for men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Testosterone is the primary cause of testicular atrophy in men. Testosterone deficiency often causes low sperm counts and diminished production. A natural herb called Tribulus Terrestris is known to increase the production of testosterone. This herb is particularly useful for those who are experiencing symptoms of low testosterone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Estrogen is known to play an important role in male pattern baldness. It's also known to cause menopausal hot flashes. When taken together with other herbs that are known to regulate estrogen levels, such as DHT, it can be very effective in alleviating menopause symptoms. It's also used to treat and prevent osteoporosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another herb that is helpful in hormone balancing is known as tribulus terrestris. It has shown significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It's especially effective against skin inflammation caused by psoriasis and dermatitis. Because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, this herb is great for treating inflammation and healing inflammation-related conditions such as arthritis, back pain, kidney stones, digestive disorders, and eczema.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andropause (or menopause) is a common cause of lowered testosterone levels. To reduce the severity of this hormonal imbalance, some women take the herb saw palmetto. Although many people believe that taking the herb to control menopause will make them less attractive, there's actually some research to suggest that the herb helps men stay longer in love with women and more fertile. As men age, the prostate hormone level of DHEA declines, which affects the ability to produce testosterone in the testicles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Phytosterol Quinine is another of the adaptogenic herbs for hormonal balance. This herb works to promote testosterone production by blocking the enzyme 5 alpha reductase (AR). This enzyme breaks down testosterone. Taking phytosterol quinine also protects the pituitary gland from harmful enzymes and other pollutants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you suffer from infertility problems, taking these herbs may be able to help improve your chances of conceiving. They're particularly beneficial if you're suffering from polycystic ovaries or endometriosis. For those who are experiencing difficulties in achieving fertility, these herbs may also help improve your chances of getting pregnant, though research is still needed to support this theory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thyroid gland. For women who are going through menopause, thyroid dysfunction can occur. There are various symptoms that occur as a result of hypothyroidism, including hair loss, fatigue, depression, low energy, increased sensitivity to cold, irregular menstrual cycles, moodiness, and skin rash. If left unchecked, hypothyroidism can cause problems with memory and concentration. Thyroid hormone is one of the hormones that regulate menstruation in both sexes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid gland and travels through the bloodstream. In most cases, it's not a problem unless it becomes too weak to function properly. The best way to treat hypothyroidism is to start an iodine supplement regimen, but there are a few thyroid herbal treatments available that can help control symptoms when thyroids get under control. This herb, which is called pueraria mirifica, can help regulate the immune system in the thyroid, while at the same time reducing the amount of thyroid hormone that's produced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chamomile can be helpful for women experiencing PMS. It's also known as St. John's Wort. It is thought to relieve stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hormone levels can fluctuate during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Women may need to take one of the herbs listed above or take herbs that increase progesterone levels to bring their hormones back up to normal ranges. There's a growing body of evidence supporting the use of certain herbs to regulate progesterone levels and maintain normal levels of estrogen. As you can see, using herbs to balance your hormones has been shown to benefit women of all ages and lifestyles.</p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Image" id="e-1598826503160" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-image" data-ver="1.0" data-id="1598826503160"><div class="elm gf-elm-center gf_elm-left-xs gf-elm-center-lg gf-elm-center-md gf-elm-center-sm gf-elm-center-xs" data-exc=""><img src="https://ucarecdn.com/1c2cc716-361a-496a-9995-d4aaafd80165/-/format/auto/-/preview/2560x2560/-/quality/lighter/" alt="Adaptogenic Herbs for Hormone Balance" class="gf_image" data-gemlang="en" title=""></div></div><!--gfsplit-->
