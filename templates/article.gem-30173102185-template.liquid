Touted for relieving anxiety and giving energy, it’s no mystery why people are intrigued by items claiming adaptogenic effect. With that said, many of us still don’t know what they actually are or how they work.<br><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adaptogens have been used for centuries in Chinese and Ayurvedic<i></i>medicine. They’re a specific group of botanicals and fungi that “adapt” (hence their name) the body to environmental stressors. When made part of our daily rituals (think <a href="https://ryzewith.com/products/recharged-ritual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">breakfast</span></a> or that <a href="https://ryzewith.com/products/recharged-ritual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">morning smoothie</span></a>), they make us more resistant to fatigue, focused, and calmer. And since most of us are <b>#stressedAF</b>, anything that helps us become more chill is a good thing. </span></p><p class="p3">&nbsp;</p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Stress hormones and a brief history of adaptogens </b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">But first, let’s talk stress. It gets a bad rap but is a necessary evil. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s pretend it’s hundreds of years ago. You’re looking out over a plain. Through the grass you spy a predator and almost immediately, your brain’s amygdala sends messages to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or “HPA axis” which is our response center for stress. It releases the hormone adrenaline which increases the heart’s rate, pumping more blood to the brain and muscles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>It also releases the hormone cortisol, which halts the body’s other operation systems so all energy can be harnessed into the impending attack. You take off running and once safe, another message goes to the HPA axis telling it to stop releasing the hormones. In a matter of minutes your other operating systems resume their work while your heart rate returns to normal. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this scenario, stress is short lived or “acute” and humans are built to handle it. It’s the chronic type - you know, what you feel during a grueling commute - that wreaks havoc on the body. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-we-worry/201811/is-there-anxiety-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">A 2018 <i>Psychology Today</i> article cited</span></a>that 1 out of 5 people experience “distressingly high levels” of anxiety regularly (1). It’s well documented how chronic stress poorly impacts health by increasing inflammation (2), weakening the immune system,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>disturbing sleep (3), inhibiting digestion (4), and causing a number of other problems. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hungarian endocrinologist Dr. Hans Selye was the first to give a scientific explanation for the biological response known as stress. Now known as the <i>Theory of Stress and General Adaption Syndrome</i>, he broke down the reaction into three phases (5): <b>Alarm</b> (the brain sending the sympathetic nervous system into flight or fight mode), <b>Resistance</b> (when the body tries to physiologically calm itself while remaining mentally alert),<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>and <b>Exhaustion</b> (when the stressors surpass the body’s ability to cope, resulting in exhaustion or death).</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The science community began examining adaptogens as a solution to combat stress in the late 1940s when the USSR was on the hunt for ways to strengthen performance and stamina in athletes, astronauts and soldiers. Russian Toxicologist Dr. Nikolai Lazarev is credited for looking at them in relation to Selye’s theory,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>noting that specific substances gave the body a “non-specific resistance” (6) to stress while also making it less sensitive to stressors. While he didn’t do an abundance of research, he studied them long enough to realize they prolonged the resistance phase and adjusted its level of homeostasis. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the fifties, Dr. Israel Brekhman, another USSR scientist, began releasing his own personal findings on adaptogens such as Siberian Ginseng, Asian or “Panax” Ginseng, Schisandra berry, and Rhodiola rosea<i></i>(golden root).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>He established the criteria for what made an adaptogen different from other herbs (7) and we still use them today. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be considered an adaptogen, a plant or fungi must do the following:</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">1) Reduce harm caused by states of stress</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">2) Have a positive excitatory impact</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"> 3) Cause no side-effects such as excess energy or insomnia </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">4) Be non-toxic in normal doses. </span></p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Okay, but how do adaptogens work?</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adaptogens combat stress by engaging the HPA axis and the sympathoadrenal system. When we’re chronically stressed, cortisol builds up in our system throwing it off balance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Working on a molecular level, adaptogens encourage the release of stress-sensor proteins (8) which lowers the hormone and increases alertness. Instead of plummeting into the exhaustion phase, the body stays in the resistance phase where it is calm but focused. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amazing, right? And there’s more. By creating a more stable environment, adaptogens act as a protectant for our other operating systems so we’re less likely to succumb to colds or gastro-issues when faced with a panic-inducing event like a work project or a weekend with the in-laws. Along with impacting the production of cortisol, they also regulate other hormones (9) like estrogen and serotonin which is why they’re great for addressing multiple health concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are primary adaptogens and secondary ones. Primary adaptogens meet Brekhman’s criteria and directly influence the HPA axis. Asian ginseng, rhodiola, Reishi, and Cordyceps would be included in this list. In contrast, secondary adaptogens do not. They do, however, impact the immune, nervous and endocrine systems,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>enhance anabolism, and include fatty acids, sterols and phenols. They have adaptogenic effect but haven’t necessarily been thoroughly researched as primary ones. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another important thing to note is that while all adaptogens influence the body in the same way, they can have differing impacts. In an <a href="https://goop.com/wellness/health/an-herbalist-on-the-healing-power-of-adaptogens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">interview for <i>Goop.com</i></span></a>, Author and Clinical Herbalist David Winston discussed this further. He says, some are stimulating, some calming, some warming, some cooling.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Based on their chemical makeup, some adaptogens can be used for non-stress related issues. For example, he says, Ashwagandha—the only adaptogen rich in iron—is useful for treating anemia.<br></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along with being linked to better moods, weight maintenance, and immunity, Adaptogens have been clinically used to alleviate arthritis (10), sleep disturbances (11), and inhibit tumor growth (12). Some, such as Golden Root, have antioxidant properties (13). Although research continues, a case is steadily growing to add them to your wellness arsenal.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here’s a list of some to familiarize yourself with:</span></p><p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Ashwagandha</b></span><span class="s1">: Cortisol regulator, thyroid boosting, <a href="http://universityhealthnews.com/daily/stress-anxiety/ashwagandha-benefits-ease-stress-and-anxiety-by-44-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">anxiety reducing</span></a>.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Astragalus:</b> High in flavonoids, protects cardiovascular system (14). </span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Chaga:</b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4361086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Anti-inflammatory</span></a>, antioxidant rich, anti-bacterial.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Cordyceps:</b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Supports physical performance</span></a>, anti-aging, inhibits tumor growth (15).</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Ginseng:</b> Improves mental performance (16) and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8750052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">male sexual performance</span></a>, boosts immune system.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Himematsutake: </b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2249742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Anti-tumor</span></a>, antiviral (17). </span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Holy Basil:</b> Vitamin rich, lowers cortisol levels, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">mood boosting</span></a>. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Licorice root:</b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870067/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Antimicrobial</span></a>, supports metabolism (18).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Lion’s mane: </b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21383512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Supports memory</span></a>, mood boosting, anti-inflammatory (19). </span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Maca:</b> Supports libido, <a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a23397426/maca-powder-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">hormone balancing</span></a>. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Reishi: </b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23796220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Supports liver</span></a>, immune system boosting, strengthens endocrine system (20).</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Rhaponticum:</b> Anti-inflammatory, cortisol regulating (21).</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Rhodiola:</b> Boosts concentration, alleviates fatigue, stress reducing (22). </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Schisandra:</b> Improves liver function, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21901061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">stress reducing</span></a>. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Shiitake:</b> Supports weight maintenance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">boosts immune system</span></a>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>vitamin rich.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Turkey tail:</b> Immune building, antimicrobial, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5302426/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">supports weight maintenance</span></a>. </span></p><p class="p7">&nbsp;</p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>How to Use Adaptogens</b></span></p><p class="p8"><span class="s1">With more people turning to natural remedies, the market is rising to meet the demand.
