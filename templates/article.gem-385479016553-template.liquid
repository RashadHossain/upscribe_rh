Also called Trametes versicolor and Polyporus versicolor, the turkey tail is found growing on tree roots and fallen tree stumps all around the world.</p><p><br>The mushroom itself is a dark brown or gray in color, but it can actually appear to be a light brownish when it is mature. It grows on decaying wood, on the undersides of leaves and on trees that are infected by fungi. A good host tree for this fungus is oak and birch. Some species of this mushroom may even grow on rocks and other natural structures that are susceptible to rotting and falling apart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These polyps are hollow, cylindrical growths that are usually small. In some species they can reach up to one inch in diameter. They are commonly found on the underside of leafy branches, twigs, needles and root systems. In fact, many types of this mushroom are quite sensitive to water; therefore, it grows best on trees with moist, well-drained soils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are several studies that have been performed on these mushrooms which show that their benefits for humans are numerous, and these benefits include anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. Their medicinal uses are varied, but they are commonly used in Asia to treat arthritis, digestive disorders, and menstrual cramps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Europe, the mushroom has been used to help people suffering from arthritis, and this treatment is commonly called "turkey tail". These polyps can also be useful in the treatment of digestive disorders and irritable bowel syndrome. When ingested, the polyps produce a toxin that will kill bacteria. This bacterium is very harmful and will cause immediate symptoms to arise, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal bloating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turkey tail mushrooms are very useful in the treatment of other conditions that affect the colon, such as diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndrome. In fact, it has even been found that they are beneficial in treating colon cancer. Because they are a naturally occurring plant, there are no drugs that have been developed specifically for this use. Therefore, the use of them is completely natural and completely safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in trying this mushroom, you should know that the only thing needed to grow this type of mushroom is a mushroom called Polyporinus, also known as Polyporus rotundus. However, you will need to purchase this particular mushroom from a reputable mushroom farmer. This mushroom grows quite well indoors but will require some sunlight in order to be effective. This mushroom is also relatively rare and will take a while to grow. Many grow it outdoors, but it may take longer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is very important to have a steady supply of water nearby, so you should place your polyps in a cool, moist location like an unheated garage. When they are growing, the water will help keep the fungi growing at a slow, steady pace. When you are harvesting, clean the mushrooms thoroughly and then remove any dead polyps to prevent mold or decay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mushrooms can be enjoyed fresh, cooked, or added to many dishes, including soups, stews, salads, casseroles, sauces, and dips. In fact, the mushrooms can often be used in so many different dishes because they have a great variety of textures, colors, and flavors. Some people even prefer to eat them raw, but most prefer to cook them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before you begin preparing any of the mushrooms for consumption, it is a good idea to test them first with a small amount. to make sure they are a pleasant flavor. When eating them, it is a good idea to take care not to overcook them or to eat them too fast. If they are overcooked, they will lose some of their vitamins and they will lose some of their nutrients as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The polyps will usually have some seeds, so when eating them, try to eat the entire polyp before it is finished to make sure the seeds do not break open. When using the mushrooms, do not peel the seeds. If you are able to, peel them after harvesting and store the skin in a plastic container in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is not much that can beat the taste of this mushroom when prepared in a Turkish delight or used as a garnish on foods. It is often served on its own as a side dish, or on top of other foods. It is also sometimes added to soups. You can also use it as a filling filler with meat dishes, or in your turkey.</p></div></div><!--gfsplit-->
