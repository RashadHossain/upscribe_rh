But types like Lion’s Mane, Reishi, and even Shiitake are simply magic.<br><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not like the psychedelic variety, mind you. Those are psilocybins and even though they may have some therapeutic qualities (in fact, states like <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/drug-facts/psilocybin-mushrooms-medicine-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Denver, CO have decriminalized them</span></a>), they remain illegal in the United States. Medicinal mushrooms, on the other hand, are legal and have been shown to strengthen the immune system, increase energy, and lower stress. And you don’t have to make them into faux burgers to enjoy their health benefits either. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fairness, most mushrooms have some nutritional value. They contain selenium, potassium and B vitamins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>But the medicinal variety are extra special because of their healing properties that make them true superfoods. Unlike other species, they’ve been scientifically researched and more western practitioners are accepting them as an important part of functional medicine. Here are 7 medicinal mushrooms worth knowing.</span></p><p class="p3">&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Chaga | </b><i>Inonotus obliquus</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Claim to Fame:</b><i>Endurance Supporter</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Heavy in antioxidants, Chaga has the highest <a href="https://www.superfoodly.com/orac-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">ORCA</span></a> (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity</span><span class="s3">)</span><span class="s1"> score of all-natural foods. It’s rich in superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that stops free radicals from mutating during oxidative stress.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxidative stress</a></span><span class="s1"> is a major concern for most athletes. It occurs when the body has too many free radicals and not enough antioxidants to neutralize them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Although it’s minimal for low to moderate activities, intense exercising, like long distance running or heavy lifting, can tax the body’s reserves of antioxidants (1), increasing the likelihood of tissue damage. The superoxide dismutase in Chaga not only helps prevent injury but inhibits the inflammation (2) trigged by chronic fatigued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>It has also been linked to increased endurance. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a 2015 study (3), subjects that took Chaga as a liquid extract were able to swim longer in comparison to subjects who were only given water. Researchers also noted that the glycogen in their muscles increased and their blood lactic acid levels became lower. For the sake of transparency, the subjects were mice, but it’s still promising, considering the other benefits.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chaga has been shown to inhibit and diminish tumor growth (4), as well as protect against cancer (5). Thanks to its high antioxidant content, it’s also considered anti-aging. It can be taken as a supplement or tincture. It can also be made into a tea by boiling chunks of the mushroom in hot water.</span></p><p class="p3">&nbsp;</p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Reishi | </b><i>Ganoderma lucidum</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Claim to Fame:</b><i>Immune Booster</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">A mushroom of many names, Reishi is sometimes referred to as the “spirit plant,” “the mushroom of immortality” and the “the divine fungus.” Along with containing zinc and iron, it has dietary fiber and amino acids. But what really makes the mushroom special is its immune enhancing bioactive components: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/triterpenoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">triterpenoids</span></a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peptidoglycan-polysaccharide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2"> polysaccharides and peptidoglycans</span></a>. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The molecules are antiviral, antimicrobial, and work as antioxidants that pump up the body’s natural defenses to fight disease (6). The polysaccharides have been a particular interest to scientists as one study showed that when an extraction of Reishi was given to advanced-stage cancer patients, their tumors shrunk and immune systems became stronger (7). </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although western practitioners are just turning onto Reishi’s anti-inflammatory (8) powers, the Chinese have been using it to treat bronchitis for centuries. Studies have shown that its compounds inhibit histamine giving it an <a href="https://www.marioninstitute.org/anti-allergy-benefits-of-reishi-and-maitake-mushrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">anti-allergy benefit </span></a>and its antioxidants strengthen the liver (9) which helps with detoxification. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reishi has also been shown to successfully lower blood sugar levels (10) and scavenge free radicals (11). There was even</span><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">one study</span></a> that indicated that it could be used to treat chronic hepatitis, hypertension, arthritis and asthma. </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Parts of the mushroom can be eaten fresh, but many enjoy the convenience of having it as a tea or incorporated into a super blend powder. </span></p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Lion’s Mane</b><b>| </b><i>Hericium erinaceus</i></span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Claim to Fame: </b><i>Brain Enhancing</i></span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">Arguably, the prettiest of the mushrooms is Lion’s Mane. Sometimes referred to as “Pom Poms,” it looks a lot like white icicles and can be found throughout North America. Considered a <i>nootropic food</i>, it has properties that improve cognitive skills. </span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">In a 2015 study (12), researchers discovered that an extract of Lion’s Mane triggered neurite outgrowth in brain, spinal cord and retinal cells. These finding could have positive applications for those suffering from neurodegenerative disease like Parkinson’s, as the mushroom may slow degeneration. In another study (13), researchers found improved cognitive function in those who took a supplement of Lion’s Mane for 16 weeks, though it should be noted that subjects test scores fell after supplementation stopped. </span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">Along with the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mushroom-memory_n_1725583?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHv1PIeehYGvI84fTXIdBTEokd7RLHumc_0ohSX73aGP_n6qUqQ-CuXxiQSwGbf4rbOUgv86fmQQ8ChSAGrR1DRReTyx9geKdGOaZag1dU7XEbw9kHXiXwMvp4pavWmV9hdmgrrHp5PQ1wPoEazRAwGtW3zAoH0iIB0BHtRmcDqt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">mushroom helping memory</span></a></span><span class="s2">,</span><span class="s1"> it’s been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety (14), prohibit the growth of cancer cells (15), and lower triglycerides (commonly known as LDL or “bad” cholesterol).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">For the epicurean who loves Lion’s Mane meaty texture (some compare it to lobster), sautéing the mushroom may be the way to go. But if your culinary skills aren’t quite there, it can also be found as a tincture or supplement. </span></p><p class="p3">&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Cordyceps | </b><i>Ophiocordyceps sinensis or Cordyceps sinensis</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Claim to Fame:</b><i>Energizing</i></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sick of relying on energy drinks to get you through the day? Cordyceps may be your new best friend. It’s polysaccharides, peptides, phenolic compounds and triterpenoids work together to stimulate multiple functional systems, resulting in the increased ability to resist<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>fatigue (16).</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike other medicinal mushrooms, Cordyceps grows on a caterpillar making it a ‘parasitic fungi’. But don’t let that fun fact scare you. It’s no danger to humans, just super beneficial.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a 2006 study, researchers gave 36 men Cordyceps supplements for two weeks. At the end of the trial, they discovered that the men who took the mushroom had a higher endurance during exercise and needed less time to recover than those who were supplementing with a placebo (17).
